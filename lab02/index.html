<h1>Cinnamon Sugar Doughnuts üç©</h1>
<h2>This is a recipe I found on Instagram a few months ago. It's a yummy treat that I always find myself craving, and I'm sure you will too.</h2>


<h3>Ingredients for this recipe:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>40g oat flour</li>
    <li>1.5 tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp cocoa powder</li>
    <li>15g natural sweetener</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>100g Greek yogurt</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
</ul>

<h3>Directions for this recipe:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients (oat flour, baking powder, cocoa powder, salt, cinnamon, sweetener, and nutmeg) and mix until evenly dispersed.</li>
    <li>Next, add in the wet ingredients (yogurt, vanilla extract, and egg) and mix until fully blended with the dry ingredients.</li>
    <li>Grab a doughnut baking sheet and pour the mixture about 2/3 of the way up each mold.</li>
    <li>Bake for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Take out and cool for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, combine any amount of cinnamon and sweetener.</li>
    <li>Take the doughnuts out of their molds and roll the top in the bowl of cinnamon sugar, then place on a plate to finish cooling.</li>
    <li>Serve or store in the fridge.</li>
</ol>

<p>This recipe is one of my favorites because not only are the doughnuts yummy, but they're about a fourth the serving of a regular doughnut. Meaning you can eat a plateful in one sitting and not feel as bloated or guilty. I've shared these doughnuts with my family, and they all agree they're delicious.</p>

<p>One of my favorite places to search for recipes is <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/" target="_blank">Simply Recipes website!</a> They have loads of delicious healthy recipes I love.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy these doughnuts as much as I do. Good luck baking!</p>
