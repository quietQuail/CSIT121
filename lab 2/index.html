<p3>This recipe is one of my favorites because not only are the doughnuts yummy, but their about a 4th the serving of a regular doughnut. Meaning you can eat a plateful in a sitting and not feel as bloated or guilty. Ive shared these doughnuts with my family and they all agree their delicious.</p3>
