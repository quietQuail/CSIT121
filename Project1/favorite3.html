        <h2>Cooking</h2>
        <p>I enjoy cooking whenever I get the chance to, one of my favorite things is to roast chickpeas and raisins and sprinkle them with cayenne seasoning. But often I use chicken in my recipes, below are two pictures of recipes I made recently. On the left is a tomato basil chicken dish I made for my grandmother and I, and on the right is broccoli cheddar stuffed chicken with ranch seasoning. I like to bake as well but Ive never taken any pictures.</p>
