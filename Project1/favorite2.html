        <h2>Traveling </h2>
        <p>I love to travel and go places with my friends and family. Life is about getting out there and seeing the beauty around you. Every year I go to Ocean City and Gettysberg for a week. But The pictures below are from two big trips I took, I went to Puerto Rico with my best friend and another time took a flight to California to see Taylor Swift with another best friend</p>
