        <h2>Visual Art</h2>
        <p>I've always enjoyed creating art since I was younger. I got massive burnout after AP art in 12th grade so I haven't made many big pieces recently. But below are a couple from lately that I'm proud of. The one on the left is fanart of Eva-02 and Kaworu Nagisa from my favorite show, and on the right are just a bunch of goofy faces. I'm going to go back and color them eventually, gel pen is one of my favorite mediums for coloring I love how the color just pops.</p>
