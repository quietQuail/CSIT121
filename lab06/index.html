<p>This recipe is one of my favorites because not only are the doughnuts yummy, but they're about a fourth the serving of a regular doughnut. Meaning you can eat a plateful in one sitting and not feel as bloated or guilty. I've shared these doughnuts with my family, and they all agree they're delicious.</p>

<p>One of my favorite places to search for recipes is <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/" target="_blank">Simply Recipes website!</a> They have loads of delicious healthy recipes I love.</p>
